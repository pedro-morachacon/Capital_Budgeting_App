# Capital Budgeting App
## Creating a quick app to Automate Capital Budgeting for Equipment in Google Sheets 

Simple web application to make capital budget investing decisions based on a Google Sheets Capital Budgeting Present Value report that the app manipulates based on the parameters entered in the HTML form to reveal itâ€™s profitability. To further optimize the app I would add to the stress testing feature by automatically running multiple scenarios in the background to determine the robustness of the investment and a sensitivity analysis on multiple factors.
